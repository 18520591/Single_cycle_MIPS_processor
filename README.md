# Verilog code for 16-bit single cycle MIPS processor
* In this project, a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor is implemented in Verilog HDL. MIPS is an RISC processor, which is widely used by many universities in academic courses related to computer organization and architecture.
* The Instruction Format and Instruction Set Architecture for the 32-bit single-cycle MIPS are as follows:

* Below is the description for instructions being implemented in Verilog:

* Based on the provided instruction set, the data-path and control unit are designed and implemented.
* Control unit design:
